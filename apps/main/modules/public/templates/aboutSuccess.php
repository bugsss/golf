        	<b>Jean-Fran√ßois Bertrand</b> was introduced to golf at an early age.  When his parents would go to the course to play their customary Saturday game, they would leave him at the range with the junior group and coach. Golf came naturally to him, but it wasn't until he moved to a small town called Victoriaville that he started taking the sport seriously, playing in some junior tours around Quebec and even working at the golf course.
       	</p>

		<p class="style1">He left the game to pursue a career in Engineering, completing his Electrical Engineering degree at "L'Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal" with a double minor in robotics and software engineering. Soon after college, he moved to Alabama to start a software consulting career. It didn't take long for his love of the game to draw him back in. After moving to Arizona in 2002, JF re-entered the game of golf with enthusiasm, lowering his handicap to a single digit and nearer to the elusive scratch golfer.
        </p>

		<p class="style1">Starting in the software consulting business, he progressed into business management and was quickly promoted to Chief Operating Officer of a gaming company called Technology Exclusive. He built two successful projects, which generated millions for the company. JF has the perfect mix of Software Engineering, management skills and passion for and understanding of the game of golf to drive Golf GamesKeeper to success.
